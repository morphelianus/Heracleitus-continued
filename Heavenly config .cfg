			description = This moon is a mystery. Due to its extrem slow rotation, high inclination and eccentricity as well as the direction in which Heracleitus orbits Kerbin scientists believe that Heracleitus wasn't fromed like Mun and Minmus in the dust cloud of Kerbin. It is believed that Heracleitus was a free-floating planet which got captured by Kerbin in a fly-by billions of years ago. \n\nThe discovery of Heracleitus was a big surprise as nobody really believed that such a strange orbit is even possible. Especially, as its color could be misinterpreted. Anyhow, scientists hope to get more answers in future, e.g. does it taste like capuccino or dark chocolate. Some earnestly hope that it is not just a proof of existence of the Kraken.
