		HeracleitusSrfLandedLowlands = The terrain appears to be made from a hardened cheddar cheese but the kerbal took to much time looking at the cheese and the rocket left without the kerbal.
		HeracleitusSrfLandedMidlands = After your kerbal dropped the sample several times due to the low gravity your kerbal was able to get a good look at the sample,the surface appears to be made of sulfur here.
		HeracleitusSrfLandedHighlands = Your kerbal was looking at the sample while strolling back to the rocket and then they tripped and flew into a hill but the hill was made of sponge so your kerbal ended out fine.(this area seems to be made of sponge)
